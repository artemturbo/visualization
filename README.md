# Turbonomic Visualization Repository

An interactive community repository for dashboard configurations to utilize with Turbonomic 8.  These are classified in three categories of dashboard types:

* Officially supported built-in dashboards - these are included in your Turbonomic instance by default and available here as base templates for easy customization
* Officially supported extended dashboards - these are available to load into your Turbonomic instance on-demand
* Community-supported - these are provided on an as-is basis and have been created by members of our Turbonomic technical and customer community

## Dashboard Designs

Each dashboard is designed in a Grafana-based implementation on a Turbonomic instance through the query builder or visual designer and exported here as an easily importable JSON file. 

Each dashboard also includes:

* Screenshot examples
* Description of the dashboard 
* Parameters and variables needed to implement
* Author
